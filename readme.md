# Shopping List App  - Simple Vanilla JS Starter Project

My first front-end/ vanilla JS project, following course/tutorial from Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 (2024) by Brad Traversy on Udemy

### Features/ Functions from Course
- Adding items to list
- Delete items from list (includes delete confirmation to ensure list items aren't deleted accidently)
- Clear All button functionality
- Clear UI State (Removes item filter and clear all button when list is empty, vice versa.)
- Filter items
- Add items to local storage
- Display items from local storage
- Remove items from local storage
- Edit and Update items 
- Prevent duplicate items on the list

### Self-added features
- New items are added to the start of the list/ as the first item on the list (previously added as the last item)
- Confirmation on on clear all button (Just made sense to add confirmation as well)
- Toggle out of edit mode by clicking the item that is in edit mode (previously had to update to exit edit mode)
- Changed edit mode visuals to change color of button background instead of text
